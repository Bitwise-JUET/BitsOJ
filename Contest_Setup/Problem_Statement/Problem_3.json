    "Problem Name": "The Fight against Terror",
    "Problem Code": "TFT",
    "Time Limit": "1",
    "Author": "Sachinam",
    "Statement": "The brave soldiers of India guard our borders 24x7 against threats to national security. To aid them in the cause, our intelligence agency, Research and Analysis Wing, listens for all possible sources of terror. Recently, they received some encrypted coordinates of terror camps. However, the encryption key is hidden inside a string S, which is known.\nS contains only digits from 0 to 9. The hidden key is the maximum sum that can be formed by \ninserting \u2018+\u2019 sign in between the characters of S and evaluating the resulting expression.\nYou can add as many \u2018+\u2019 signs as possible,possibly 0, just keeping in mind that no two \u2018+\u2019 signs are consecutive.\nCan you help our agents in cracking the code?",
    "Input": "Single String S",
    "Output": "Print the sum of the evaluated value over all possible formulas.",
    "Constraints": "    \u2022 1\u2264|S|\u226410\n    \u2022 All letters in S are digits between \u20181\u2019 and \u20189\u2019, inclusive.",
    "Example Input": "132",
    "Example Output": "186"

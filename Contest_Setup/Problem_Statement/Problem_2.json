    "Problem Statement": "There are M criminals and N Gun Shops on a map .\n\nThe coordinates of the i-th criminal  ( 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N) is (ai , bi), and the coordinates of the gun shop numbered   j ( 1 \u2264 j \u2264 M ) is ( cj , dj ) .\n\nSuppose a criminal is going for buying a gun to kill Sherlock so you will go to the nearest Gun Shop measured in Manhattan distance. \n\nThe Manhattan distance between two points (x1 , y1) and (x2 , y2) is  |x1\u2212x2| + |y1\u2212y2|.\n\nHere, |x| denotes the absolute value of x.\n\nIf there are multiple nearest shops for a criminal, he/she will select the shop with the smallest index i.e the shop which comes first in the order .\n\nWhich shop will each criminal  go to ?\n",
    "Input": "\nThe first line of input contains the value of N ,M .\n\nThen N lines follow denoting the index of each criminal .\n\nThen M lines follow denoting the index of each gun shop.\n",
    "Output": "The output contains N lines .\nEach line denoting the shop that i-th criminal will go to .\n",
    "Constraints": "1 \u2264 N , M  \u2264  50\n\u221210^8 \u2264   ai,bi,cj,dj    \u2264   10^8\nAll input values are integers.\n",
    "Example Input": "2 2\n2 0\n0 0\n-1 0\n1 0\n",
    "Example Output": "2\n1\n"

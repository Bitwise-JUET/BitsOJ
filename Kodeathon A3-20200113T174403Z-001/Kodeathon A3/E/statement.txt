Arya has N weapons where i-th weapon can do a damage between l[i] to r[i] inclusive. The great war has started and she needs to select her weapons for the war. She can only take K weapons to the war. Due to some unnamed logic, she has to choose K weapons such that the intersection of damage range between all the K weapons is as large as possible. 

Can you help her in selecting K best weapons?

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers N and K (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) — the number of weapons Arya has, and the number of weapons she wants to choose.

Each of the next N lines contains two integers li and ri ( - 10^9 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 10^9) — the description of the i-th weapon. 

Output Format:
In the first line print single integer, the length of maximum intersection possible if she chooses K optimal weapons.


Sample Input 1:
5 2
1 10
5 15
14 50
30 70
